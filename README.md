"DESCRIPTION":

A real-time collaborative document editor using Next.js is a web application that allows multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously. Built with Next.js, it combines both frontend and backend in one framework, offering fast performance, server-side rendering, and easy API integration.

The core of collaboration is handled using WebSockets or Socket.IO, which syncs document changes across users instantly. When one user edits the document, others see the update in real time without refreshing. Document data is stored in databases like MongoDB or Firebase, ensuring persistence and version control.

Key features:

Real-time text editing by multiple users

User authentication and access control

Auto-save and version history

Commenting and change tracking

Responsive UI with tools like Tailwind CSS

This type of app is ideal for:

Team projects and notes

Online coding or writing platforms

Shared meeting minutes or reports

It delivers fast, interactive collaboration, all powered by Next.js.
